- Execute queries using variables against configurable endpoints, including support for custom headers and environment variables
- Schema-aware completion, error highlighting, and documentation
- Syntax highlighting, code-formatting, folding, commenter, and brace-matching
- 'Find Usages' and 'Go to Declaration' for schema types, fields, and fragments

## Acknowledgements

This plugin was heavily inspired by [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) from Facebook.

A number of language features such as query and schema validation are powered by [graphql-java](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java).

A thanks also goes out to the [Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql) and [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma) teams for their continued efforts to improve the GraphQL Developer Experience.

And finally, a thank you to the [JetBrains WebStorm team](https://twitter.com/WebStormIDE) and the Alpha/Beta testers for all their help in getting the 2.0 release across the finish line.
