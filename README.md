# JS GraphQL IntelliJ Plugin

GraphQL language support including Relay.QL tagged templates in JavaScript and TypeScript.

It provides the following features in IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm, RubyMine, PhpStorm, and PyCharm:

- Schema-aware completion, error highlighting, and documentation
- Syntax highlighting, code-formatting, folding, commenter, and brace-matching
- 'Find Usages' and 'Go to Declaration' for schema types and fields
- Schema viewer and 'Go to Implementation' for schema interfaces
- 'Structure view' to navigate GraphQL and GraphQL Schema files
- Configurable GraphQL schema retrieval and reloading based on a local file or a url using 'then-request'
- Execute queries with variables against configurable endpoints

It depends on [js-graphql-language-service](https://github.com/jimkyndemeyer/js-graphql-language-service) that it manages using a Node.js process handler.

## Documentation

The plugin uses a `graphql.config.json` file in the project root to configure the location of your GraphQL schema.

To get started, please see the [FAQ](#faq).

## FAQ

**How do I configure the plugin in a project**

The plugin is activated as soon as you view or edit GraphQL in the editor. This includes GraphQL inside `Relay.QL` and `gql` templates in JavaScript and TypeScript. You can also use `.graphql` physical files and scratch files. These files allow you to query your endpoint directly from your IDE.

An editor notification bar should prompt you to "Create a graphql.config.json". Accept and edit this config file to point the plugin at your local `schema.json` or your endpoint for introspection. The plugin uses the schema to provide completion and error highlighting.

**How do I reload a GraphQL Schema that was loaded from a URL?**

In the the GraphQL tool window, select the "Current Errors" tab and click the "Restart JS GraphQL Language Service" button. 

**I clicked "No thanks" when asked to create a graphql.config.json. Now what?**

Download [graphql.config.json](https://github.com/jimkyndemeyer/js-graphql-intellij-plugin/blob/master/resources/META-INF/graphql.config.json) from this repository and place it in your project root (next to your package.json for JS projects). Re-open the project and edit `graphql.config.json` to point the plugin at your schema.

**Fields are shown as errors with "Cannot query field..." messages**

Make sure you've edited your `graphql.config.json` to point it at your schema. This enables the plugin to properly recognize the available types and their fields.

Make sure both the schema "file" or "url" and the endpoints "url" are correct.

**Which IDEs are compatible with the plugin?**

The plugin is compatible with version 143+ of IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm, RubyMine, PhpStorm, and PyCharm.

PyCharm CE is not supported since the plugin depends on two other plugins: NodeJS and JavaScript.

Experimental support for Android Studio is available in the [`android-studio`](https://github.com/jimkyndemeyer/js-graphql-intellij-plugin/tree/android-studio) branch. Download it from there.

**Where can I get the plugin?**

The plugin is available from the JetBrains Plugin Repository at https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8097?pr=

To install it, open "Settings", "Plugins", "Browse repositories..." and search for "GraphQL".

**Note**: The experimental version in the `android-studio` branch is not available from the JetBrains Plugin Repository.
