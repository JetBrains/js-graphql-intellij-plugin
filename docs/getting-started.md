## Prerequisites

The plugin and this documentation site assumes you are already familiar with the GraphQL language. If you're not, please
visit the official [graphql.org](https://graphql.org/) website first.

The plugin works out of the box with popular GraphQL clients such as [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/) and 
[Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/), but you're free to choose your client and server frameworks. 

## Installation

The plugin is hosted in the JetBrains Plugin Repository at https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8097-js-graphql

You can install it directly from your IDE via the "Settings > Plugins" screen.

On the "Marketplace" tab simply search for "graphql" and select the "JS GraphQL" suggestion:
